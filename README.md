## Overview

#### C++ is an object-oriented programming language that is used to implement real-world entities like inheritance, hiding, polymorphism, etc into programs. Object-oriented programming languages achieve this using classes and object

## What is a Class in C++?

#### A class in C++ is a user-defined type or data structure declared with a keyword class that has data and functions as its members. A class can be used by declaring an instance of that class which is nothing but an object in C++

## Ex.
#### In real life, we see dogs with different breeds or classes but there are some common characteristics such as they have a tail, they bark, they sniff, etc. So, instead of creating a different class for every dog, we can define a single class with common properties of dogs. Hence, Classes act as a user-defined data type to create objects with similar properties.

## What is an Object in C++?

#### A class is merely a blueprint of data. An object is a data structure that is an instance of a class. So when a class is created no memory is allocated but when an instance is created by declaring an object, memory is then allocated to store data and perform required functions on them
